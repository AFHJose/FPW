The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).

Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top. 

position: static;
    
    HTML elements are positioned static by default.

    Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

position: relative;

    An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

    Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
